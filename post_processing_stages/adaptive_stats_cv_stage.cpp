Some helpful hints on writing your own stages:

Generally, the Process method should not take too long as it will block the imaging pipeline 
and may cause stuttering.
When time-consuming algorithms need to be run, it may be helpful to delegate them to 
another asynchronous thread.

When delegating work to another thread, the way image buffers are handled currently 
means that they will need to be copied.
For some applications, such as image analysis, 
it may be viable to use the "low resolution" image stream rather than full resolution images.

The post-processing framework adds multi-threading parallelism on a per-frame basis. 
This is helpful in improving throughput if you want to run on every single frame. 
Some functions may supply parallelism within each frame (such as OpenCV and TFLite). 
In these cases it would probably be better to serialise the calls so as to suppress 
the per-frame parallelism.

Most streams, and in particular the low resolution stream, have YUV420 format. 
These formats are sometimes not ideal for OpenCV or TFLite so there may sometimes 
need to be a conversion step.

When images need to be altered, doing so in place is much the easiest strategy.
